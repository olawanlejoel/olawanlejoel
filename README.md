### Hi there 👋

I'm Joel Olawanle from Nigeria — a Software Engineer, Technical Writer, Open Source Contributor, and Speaker passionate about building tools, writing technical content, and sharing knowledge with the developer community.

💡 I combine frontend engineering with technical writing, video creation, and public speaking to empower developers globally. Over the years, I’ve worked with leading developer-focused companies like Kinsta, freeCodeCamp, Hygraph, Cloudinary, Appwrite, and LogRocket.

✍️ I’ve authored 300+ technical articles, read by millions of developers worldwide. My work has been translated into multiple languages, helping developers in diverse communities learn and grow.
